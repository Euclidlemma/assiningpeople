This is a program from the project of University of Waterloo, Fall 2021, in CS 350. This program solves following problem:

We have n people lined up. Person i needs qi minutes for their consultation. There are t rooms which the consultations to be held, and each room can be used as maximum L minutes. This program assign the people to the rooms so that the first n1 go to room 1, the next n2 go to room 2, . . . , the last nt goto room t. We will give gap between succesive people who use the room. 

This program will maximize the minimum gap between any two people.

The input that this program take is :
first line- n, t, L.
second line- n integers, which are the time that each people will use the room.

This demonstrates the dynamic programming skills.
